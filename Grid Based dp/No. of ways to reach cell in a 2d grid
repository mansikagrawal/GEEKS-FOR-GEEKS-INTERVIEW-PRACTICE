/* Number of ways to reach a cell in 2d grid
    Finding the Number of ways to reach a particular position from a given starting point
    in 2D grid and given you are - 
    1) Rat (Right and down 1 step)
    2) Elephant in chess ( Right and down K step)
    
    
    Hint for rat problem - To reach a position you had to go either right or down. MAke permutations
    of right and down Let m and n be the rows and columns. 
    The combination would be (m-1 + n-1)!/ (m-1)! * (n-1)! (Note - Cant be applied if some cells
    are blocked)
    
    
    Hint for Elephant problem - The elepehant can take k steps to the tc will be O(N^3) because for every 
    grid we need to make the sum of wrows upto that grid and sum of columns upto that grid.
